# create a program that asks the user for a letter
# and then converts that letter to uppercase or lowercase, depending on the letter
# also validate input, so that if the user doesn't enter a letter it will not run
# also make sure that the user only enters 1 letter
# for reference, "A" is 65 in ASCII and "a" is 97 in ASCII
